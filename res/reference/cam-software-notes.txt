
Features I need to have:
  - Pocketing
  
  - Profiling
  - Facing
  - Engraving
  
  - Hole Making
  - Thread Milling 

  - V-Carving (Using a V shaped bit with different depths to cut inverse bevels for shapes)
  - V-Carve Roughing ???
  - Chamfering ??

===============================================================
Maybees:

  - Backlash Compensation? Seems like a feature for the controller
  - Feed rate accel/decel clamp? Seems like a feature for the controller

  - Visual Mill
      Attractive looking
  - Vetric
      Looks like a bunch of producs, from 
  - Surf cam 2-axis
      Pocket and finish cavities with multiple island heights and tapered sidewalls.
      Advanced strategies for face milling, groove, corner round, and chamfering.
      Support for 4- and 5-Axis rotary indexing and high speed machining.
      Rest machining detects and machines areas left by previous cutting tool.
      Advanced multi-tool hole processing with intelligent pattern sorting
      Tapered thread milling with helical entry/exit.
      Associative toolpath updates the toolpath of modified part geometry.
