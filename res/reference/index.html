		<h1>ScriptableMill</h1>
		<h3>A solution for processing a variety of .dxf files into 3 axis milling machine-specific GCode</h3>
		<p>ScriptableMill was written to fulfill a variety of needs I had for a CAM program that could turn dxf files I crafted in Inkscape, into runnable g-code for my 3 axis CNC mill. Originally I had design the system around a GUI like many other CAM programs out there, but being a programmer (and a stickler for good UI) it was quickly becoming too much work to maintain, and didn't provide precise enough control. Additionally, I found it diffcult to determine where problems were occuring in the process of converting my cad files into runnable g-code. 
		</p>
		<p>Since I rewrote the program to use a command-based interface, it removed the requirement to write complicated user interface code. Additionally, the intermediate text file format and the coresponding command file is much easier to follow and debug, and g-code can be regenerated on the fly for use by <a href="http://www.machsupport.com/">Mach3</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxcnc.org/">EMC2</a>.</p>

			<tr><td><strong>save</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>[filename without spaces]</td><td><pre>importDXF myFile.dxf<br />clean<br />save myProcessedFile.txt</pre></td><td>This command saves the currently working layer to disk for later use. The format is a simple text based format containing collections of 3D points. It's designed to be as simple as possible for easy debugging.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td><strong>load</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>[filename without spaces]</td><td><pre>load myProcessedFile.txt<br />select path 0<br />set feedRate 400<br />cutAlongPaths<br />display</pre></td><td>This command loads the path file into a new layer and sets it as the currently working layer.</td></tr>

It removes duplicate points and empty paths. In most cases you will want to clean your DXF files after import, before saving them to the simple path format.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td><strong>select</strong></td><td><strong>path</strong></td><td>[0 to layer's path count-1]</td><td><pre>load myProcessedFile.txt<br />select path 0<br />select path 1<br />display</pre></td><td>This program adds a path from the current working layer into the selection. You can add as many paths from any layers into the selection. Many commands only operate on what's currently selected, providing a system for selectively batching operations. This is one of the most commonly used commands.</td></tr>

A new layer is created each time the <strong>load</strong> command or <strong>importDXF</strong> command is called. This makes it possible to run commands on paths from different layers. To do so you would select some paths from the active layer, then switch to a different layer with this command and selection some additional paths. It is important to note that paths are indexed from 0 to the number of paths - 1 in EACH layer. So duplicate indexes are valid between separate layers.</td></tr>

It always moves the tool to the origin along the z axis first, then interpolates to the first point in the path specified. This is only required between cuts of different selections. When more than one path is selected and cut using either the <strong>cutAroundPaths</strong> command or the <strong>cutAlongPaths</strong> command, jogToPath will automatically be performed between cuts.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td><strong>cutAroundPaths</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>[distance from path along normal]</td><td><pre>load myProcessedFile.txt<br />select path 0<br />cutAroundPaths 2.0<br />display</pre></td><td>This is currently one of the most useful commands in this suite. <strong>cutAlongPaths</strong> will generate a cutting path that is offset along the normal of the path over all of the selected paths by a specified amount.<br />If you have a tool with a radius of  2 milimeters, you can cut around the path 2 milimeters away and know that you're final shape will be exactly the path described in the cad file. Additionally, you can provide sequential offsets to pocket convex paths. (Concave paths still work however intersections are not resolved on non-adjacent overlapping paths so care must be taken by the user to verify acurate pathing.) If a selected path's normals are facing the wrong direction for this command, just call the <strong>flip</strong> command first to change their orientation.</td></tr>

If more than one path is selected, <strong>jogToPath</strong> will automatically be called between cuts.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td><strong>build</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>[gcode filename without spaces]</td><td><pre>load myProcessedFile.txt<br />select all<br />cutAlongPaths<br />build gcode.txt<br />display</pre></td><td>Turns all of the cutting paths generated by the script into runnable gcode, and saves it to disk.
