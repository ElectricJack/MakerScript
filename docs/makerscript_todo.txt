    // A vertex is a position along with other information such as color, normal vector and texture coordinates.
    
    // An edge is a connection between two vertices.
    
    // A loop is a closed set of edges
    
    // A face is one outer loop and potentially one or more inner loops all on the same plane,
       on the surface of the mesh with a normal pointing to the outside of the face
    
    // Can have child mesh objects
    
    // Can have instances of child mesh objects with transform (VQS?)
